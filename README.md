# Dungeon-Crawler
A project I'm currently working on inspired by traditional first person dungeon crawler rpg titles like Wizardry as well as more modern titles like Etrian Odyssey and Stranger of Sword City. As of right now the game is just a maze for the player to explore however combat is mostly done at this point and should be ready soon.
