# Dungeon-Crawler
A project I'm currently working on inspired by traditional first person dungeon crawler rpg titles like Wizardry as well as more modern titles like Etrian Odyssey and Stranger of Sword City. The player can explore a 3D dungeon with a preset party of adventurers. Random battles with monsters will occur as the player navigates the maze. Combat is handled in fairly typical turn based dungeon rpg fashion.

# Dungeon Controls
Press the up and down arrow keys to move 1 space forward or backward.
Press the left and right arrow keys to turn.
Press escape to close the game.
Press 'b' to force start a battle.

# Windows Installation
1. From the releases directory download the zip file for the version of your choice. Pick either the 32 or 64 bit version based on your computer. If you're unsure just get the 32 bit version.
2. Unzip the folder.
3. Store it where ever you want on your computer.
4. Run game.exe in the unzipped folder.
